# baseball-ERA-prediction
A statistical modeling project focused on predicting Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers' Earned Run Average (ERA) using advanced regression techniques. This repository contains data preprocessing scripts, linear and regularized regression models (Ridge, LASSO, Elastic Net), model diagnostics, and visualizations. The project leverages 2023 season pitching data to identify key performance metrics—like whiff percentage and weighted on-base average (wOBA)—that significantly influence ERA while addressing multicollinearity and overfitting. Ideal for those interested in sports analytics, predictive modeling, and applied machine learning in R.
