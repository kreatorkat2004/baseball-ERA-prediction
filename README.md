# Predicting Baseball Pitcher's Earned Run Average (ERA)

A comprehensive statistical analysis project that develops predictive regression models to forecast a baseball pitcher's Earned Run Average (ERA) using various performance metrics and advanced regularization techniques.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes 2023 MLB pitching data to identify the most significant predictors of pitcher performance and build robust predictive models. Using a dataset with 106+ potential predictors, we employ multiple regression techniques to address challenges like multicollinearity and overfitting.

### Key Objectives
- Identify the most significant predictors of pitcher ERA
- Develop models balancing accuracy and interpretability  
- Address multicollinearity using advanced regression techniques
- Validate models through comprehensive diagnostic testing

## üéØ Research Questions

1. Which performance metrics are the most significant predictors of a pitcher's ERA?
2. How do advanced regression techniques (Ridge, LASSO, Elastic Net) improve model performance?
3. What are the potential issues of multicollinearity in the dataset, and how can they be mitigated?
4. How well does the final model generalize to new data based on diagnostic assessments?

## üìà Dataset

### Data Sources
- **Pitching Data 2023** (`pitching_data_2023.csv`): Comprehensive pitching statistics for the 2023 MLB season
- **Additional Stats** (`additional_stats.csv`): Supplementary performance metrics

### Key Variables
- **Target Variable**: `p_era` (Pitcher's Earned Run Average)
- **Key Predictors**:
  - `k_percent`: Strike/strikeout percentage
  - `bb_percent`: Walk percentage  
  - `whiff_percent`: Swing-and-miss percentage
  - `woba`: Weighted on-base average
  - `xba`: Expected batting average
  - `player_age`: Pitcher's age
  - `swing_percent`, `hard_hit_percent`: Batting quality metrics

## üî¨ Methodology

### Models Tested

1. **Model 1**: `p_era ~ k_percent + bb_percent`
   - Hypothesis: Basic strikeout/walk stats affect performance

2. **Model 2**: `p_era ~ woba + whiff_percent` ‚≠ê **Best Initial Model**
   - Hypothesis: Preventing strong batting and inducing misses impacts effectiveness
   - **AIC: 91.89** (lowest)

3. **Model 3**: `p_era ~ player_age + xba * woba`
   - Hypothesis: Age and expected batting performance influence ERA

4. **Model 4**: `p_era ~ swing_percent + hard_hit_percent + whiff_percent`
   - Hypothesis: Swing behavior and contact quality explain performance

5. **Model 5**: `p_era ~ player_age * k_percent + bb_percent`
   - Hypothesis: Control, strikeouts, and age impact ERA

### Advanced Techniques

#### Regularization Methods
- **Ridge Regression**: Handles multicollinearity by adding L2 penalty
- **LASSO Regression**: Performs feature selection via L1 penalty  
- **Elastic Net**: Combines Ridge and LASSO for optimal balance ‚≠ê **Final Model**

#### Model Validation
- Residual analysis and QQ-plots
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis
- Cook's Distance and leverage analysis
- Durbin-Watson and Ljung-Box tests for autocorrelation
- Cross-validation for parameter tuning

## üèÜ Key Results

### Final Model Performance
- **Correlation Coefficient**: 0.8086 (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.65)
- **Final Predictors**: k_percent, bb_percent, woba, xba, and woba:xba interaction
- **Key Insights**:
  - `whiff_percent` and `woba:xba` interaction emerged as most crucial predictors
  - Regularization techniques significantly improved model stability
  - Multicollinearity successfully addressed (VIF values within acceptable ranges)

### Notable Outliers
Elite pitchers identified as influential points:
- Shohei Ohtani (extreme innings pitched)
- Blake Snell (exceptional performance profile)
- Spencer Strider (high strikeout/walk combination)
- Michael Kopech (unique statistical profile)
